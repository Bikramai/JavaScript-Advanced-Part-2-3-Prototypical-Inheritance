    <h1>Polymorphism</h1>
    <p1> Polymorphism :- means poly means many, morph means form. so polymorphism mean many forms.
        It's an extremely powerful technique in object-oriented programming.
        Each object will provide a different implementation of the duplicate method.
        so we have many implementations, or many forms of the duplicate method.
